# (- PROJECT: Building with Responsive Design - )
In this project, you’ll get the chance to build a responsive website. We’ll be cloning The Next Web, a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced. You can find the original project specification at: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-responsive-design
