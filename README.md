# Building with Responsive Design
In this project, you‚Äôll get the chance to build a responsive website. We‚Äôll be cloning The Next Web, a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced. 

You can find the original project specification at: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-responsive-design
